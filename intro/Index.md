# About "Linux"

- Linux comes in "distributions" that are collections of 10's of thousands of individual application packages
- Those packages are mostly all from separate authors/teams, and chosen and bundled by the distributions
- "Linux" is only the kernel that manages the hardware and launches applications, and is about the only guaranteed common thing between distros

---
# About distributions

- Distrowatch is currently tracking 274 distros
- Most of those are variants of a few major ones:
  - Debian / Ubuntu
  - RedHat / Fedora
  - Arch
- Sometimes the variants are famous in their own right: Mint, CentOS, Kali
- Sometimes they're very minor changes

---
# About desktop environments

- One of the biggest changes you'll see between distros is their default window manager and desktop environment
- Popular choices include: Gnome, KDE, Cinnamon, XFCE, and i3/Sway
- Big distros package multiple WM/DE - you do not need to reinstall to switch, just install the packages

---
# About licensing

- Common to all of this is a belief that software's source code should be available to users to observe and modify
- Sometimes you're free to do whatever you like with the code - MIT/BSD/Apache licenses
- Sometimes making changes requires you to publish your changes freely as well - GPL
- This belief is not limited to Linux, and you can find many open-source applications and communities within Windows and Mac as well

---
# About history

- Linux was started by Linus Torvalds in 1991, as a side-project while he was a student at the University of Helsinki
  - Frustrated with existing systems
  - "just a hobby, won't be big and professional"
- Today, 100s of developers contribute, often as part of their job
- Changes are sent via email and are merged by subsystem maintainers
- New major release every 8-10 weeks
- Roughly 5 years of patches for selected "long-term" versions

---
# About getting started

- Pick a distro you'd like to try. Stay with a major one like Ubuntu or Fedora, since they'll be better tested and documented
- Absolutely try others later, once you've learned some basics and know what differences you want
- Download an ISO file
- Decide if you want to use a virtual machine, spare computer, or dual-boot

---
# About virtual machines

- A virtual machine allows you to create an isolated mini computer inside your regular system
- Popular options include: VirtualBox, VMware, and Parallels
- You can create multiple machines, and start/stop them as needed
- Small performance penalty for faking real hardware
- Beware, can use a significant percentage of your CPU, RAM, and disk

---
# About other options

- Spare old laptops are easy and cheap
- Repartitioning and dual-booting is risky and interrupts your other work, but allows you to run at full speed
- CS labs & stu server available to experiment
- WSL & Mac Terminal offer many of the same utilities
- Cloud free tier
